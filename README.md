Our team decided to do use Machine Learning Algorithms on American Express client data to predict if they will default on their credit card or not. We used five classifiers: Logistic Regression Decision Trees & Random Forests, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks to make models and compared them against each other to find the most accurate model that fits our testing data.

One of the main reasons behind our final project stems from wanting to use real world data, thats a given, but we also wanted to find data that is applicable to our every day lives. What is something we all use everyday, at times forgetting the power we hold in our pockets, wallets, and phones? Credit cards. This idea lead us to be excited by the implications for people using our sight for personal reasons. As well on the coporate side, where we can use our code to help them make decisions or adjuct policies to get less credit card defaults overall. Our project is simple, but powerful. We hope you explore our website, and get inspired for your own machine learning projects in the future!


### Our Project is hosted on Heroku [here](https://credit-default-practice.herokuapp.com/)

To use the the "Will I Default?" Predictor
1. Go to the tab that has "Will I Default?" on it
2. Enter numerical information in each category.
3. Then press the submit button for a prediction, which will either come up "Default" or "No-Default".
4. If said information put in to each category is accurate for your own finances, then the prediction may make your day a bit more stressful depending on the outcome.
5. Enjoy.
